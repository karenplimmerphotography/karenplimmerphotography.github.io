                <h3>Beginnings</h3>
                <p>As I lay back down on the grass they launch themselves simultaneously on top of me.
                    Although it's fun to play tug-o-war with my sleeves by far the greatest prize is a healthy mouthful
                    of hair.
                    Terriers have more energy than all other breeds of dogs put together and young puppies have such pin
                    sharp teeth.
                    So I shield my camera carefully yet forgive them instantly. As I frame the perfect picture, about to
                    press the shutter,
                    one of them leaps onto my face.
                    Finally, the sun drops near the horizon and one by one they begin to tire, each snuggling onto my
                    lap.</p>
                <p><strong><em>This is how my love of photography began. And I look forward to reliving these moments
                            whenever I can.</em></strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="about a2 purple">
                <h3 class="purple">Second love</h3>
                <p class="purple"><strong><em>My love of all things nature soon developed into a passion for landscape
                            photography.</em></strong></p>

            <div class="about a3">
                <h3>Where you can find me plus my favourite places</h3>
                <p>I live on the Gold Coast, Australia but at heart I'm a New Zealander. So I love to return home to
                    marvel at snowcapped mountains
                    mirrored in azure lakes and to capture the soul of wild and desolate beaches in my photographs.
                    And to get to my next destination I can't beat driving along quiet country roads dotted with lupins.
                </p>
                <p>Wanaka and Tekapo are my favourite places to visit in New Zealand but on a perfect day the grandeur
                    of the untamed West Coast can't be beaten. </p>

                <h3 class="purple">I hope that</h3>
                <p class="purple"> Through my photographs I hope to inspire people to travel and see the world.
                    For travel can act in a powerful way to change people for the better.
                    I hope that on returning home they act in ways that are kinder to animals, the environment and to
                    humanity.</p>
                <p class="purple">I hope that their lives are richer through experiences and memories.
                    And when they visit I hope that they hop off the beaten track and muddy their boots for their
                    conversations will be all the richer for doing so.</p>
